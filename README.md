## Overview <a name="overview"></a>
This SDK library provides reference implementation of ISO 20022 Digital Signature specification to sign and verify XML messages. 
It assumes that you have read the specification prior to coming here.

Refer to [ISO20022 Signed Unsigned Message Examples](docs/ISO20022_Example_Signed_Unsigned_Message.md) for understanding the difference between a signed and unsigned message.

In Signed XML payload, you will see three reference nodes:
* Resource as uri="" - will get resolved to AppHdr
* Resource with no uri - will get resolved to Document
* Resource as uri="#id" - will get resolved to element as per that id value

### Compatibility <a name="compatibility"></a>
Java 11+

Maven 3.6.1+

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

### Signing the request <a name="signrequest"></a>

XmlSignUtil.sign(Document document, SignatureInfo signatureInfo, SignatureKeyInfo signatureKeyInfo) signs the XML Document where:
  * document - the unsigned payload 
  * signatureInfo - signature info which is used in signing the payload
  * signatureKeyInfo - signature key info which holds private key and ski bytes to be set in X509 Data element

Refer to [detailed message signing flow](docs/MessageSigningFlow.md)


### Verifying the request <a name="verifyrequest"></a>

XmlSignUtil.verify(Document document, PublicKey publicKey) verifies the signed payload where:
  *  document - the signed payload
  *  publicKey - the public key

Refer to [detailed message verification flow](docs/MessageVerificationFlow.md)
